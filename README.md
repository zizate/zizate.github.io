# Gatsby's Typescript + Material-ui starter

Kick off your project with this [Material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) boilerplate (forked from [this](https://github.com/Junscuzzy/gatsby-material-typescript-starter) repository and edited with personal preferences). 

This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the starter
    gatsby new gatsby-material-typescript-starter https://github.com/Lindeneg/gatsby-material-typescript-starter
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd gatsby-material-typescript-starter/
    yarn develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `gatsby-material-typescript-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.tsx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

All the commands are in your `package.json > scripts`.
